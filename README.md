# Improved Attacks against Reduced-Round Whirlwind-The MITM (Pseudo-)Preimage Attacks on Whirlwind

-MITMPRE_whirlwind_guess_7: Source code for the 7-round pseudo-preimage attack on the Whirlwind hash function. 

-MITMPRE_whirlwind_guessfix_4_step1: Source code for the 1st step of 4-round preimage attack on the Whirlwind hash function. We give a 4-round chunk separation with half of X_0 set to zero due to the output transformation.

-MITMPRE_whirlwind_guessfix_4_step2: Source code for the 2nd step of 4-round preimage attack on the Whirlwind hash function. We give a 4-round chunk separation with 256 padding bits in X_0.

-MITMPRE_whirlwind_guessfix_4_step3: Source code for the 3rd step of 4-round preimage attack on the Whirlwind hash function.

It takes about a hour to find the solutions for (pseudo-)preimage attacks.
